## Extension Lambdas (#2)

Import `sandwich.*` and create a function `sandwich2()` following the example
of `sandwich()`. Insert a first parameter `prepare`, which is an extension
lambda that allows the user to choose whether to toast the `Sandwich`, with the
default untoasted.

Add a function `sandwich3()` which is an extension function for `Sandwich`. The
user can provide a `Sandwich` receiver that may or may not be already toasted.

The starter code and the code in `main()` tests your functions.
