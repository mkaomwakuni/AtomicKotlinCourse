## Scope Functions (#3)

The starter code includes a definition for `class Math`. Create a `Math`
instance with a `run` scope. Inside that scope, define `val z` which is
initialized by calling `np(11, 7)` with an `apply` scope. Inside that scope call
`add() + subtract()` and after closing the scope, call `calc()`. Use `eq` to
check that the result is 77. The return value from the `run()` scope is `z +
add()`; use `eq` to check that the result is 1077.
