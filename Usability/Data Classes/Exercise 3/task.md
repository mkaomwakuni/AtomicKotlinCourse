## Data Classes (#3)

The starter code contains definitions for the `data` classes `Author` and
`Book`. Write a function called `createAuthorToBooksMap()` that takes a `List`
of books as its parameter. It builds and returns a `Map` with `Author` as the
key that maps to the `List<Book>` written by that author.
