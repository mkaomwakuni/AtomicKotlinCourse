## Safe Calls & the Elvis Operator (#3)

Implement an extension function for `Client` called `fullInfo()` that returns a
`String`. This result contains the properties of the class as in the example
below. If a property is `null`, use `"Unspecified"` for its value:

```text
name: Alice
email: alice@gmail.com
country: Germany
city: Munich
street: Unspecified
```
