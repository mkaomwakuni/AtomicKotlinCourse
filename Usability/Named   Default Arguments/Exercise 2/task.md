## Named & Default Arguments (#2)

Define a class `SimpleTime` that stores the time elapsed from the beginning of
the day. `SimpleTime`'s constructor takes four parameters: `hours`, `minutes`,
`seconds` and `nanoseconds`. Each parameter has a default value of zero.

Implement two member functions, `toSecondOfDay()` and `toNanoOfDay()`, that
return the number of seconds or nanoseconds elapsed since the beginning of the
day.
