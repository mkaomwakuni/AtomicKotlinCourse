## Nullable Types (#2)

Write a function called `zilch()` that takes no arguments, has a function return
type of `String`, and returns `null`. Write a second function `zilch2()` which
returns the result of calling `zilch()`, and has an explicit return type.
What must you change to get this code to compile?

In `main()`, call `zilch()` and assign the result to a `var` that you explicitly
type. Do the same for `zilch2()`.
