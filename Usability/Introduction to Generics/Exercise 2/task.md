## Introduction to Generics (#2)

Implement a generic `reversed()` extension function for `List`, which returns a
new `List` containing the same elements but in reverse order.

This function already exists in the standard Kotlin library, but for learning
purposes you should implement it from scratch.

<div class="hint">

Use `N downTo 0` to iterate through the indices in reverse order.
