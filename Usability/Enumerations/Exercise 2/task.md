## Enumerations (#2)

Implement two extension functions `Month.getAustralianSeason()` and
`Month.getDays(leapYear: Boolean)`. The `leapYear` parameter should have a
default argument of `false`.

In Australia, the seasons are defined by grouping the calendar months:

+ Spring: The transition months September, October and November

+ Summer: The hottest months December, January and February

+ Autumn: The transition months March, April and May

+ Winter: The coldest months June, July and August
