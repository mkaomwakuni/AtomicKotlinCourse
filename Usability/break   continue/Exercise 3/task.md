## `break` & `continue` (#3)

This exercise demonstrates how you can replace `break` and `continue` with
`return` by extracting code into new functions.

The functions `usingBreak()` and `usingContinue()` are provided in the starter
code. Your task is to extract part of `usingBreak()` into `analyzeList()` and
part of `usingContinue()` into `analyzeElement()` so that `break` and
`continue` can be replaced with `return` without changing the logic of these
functions.
