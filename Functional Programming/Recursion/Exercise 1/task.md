## Recursion (#1)

Write a tail recursive function called `simulation()` that takes a `String`
called `group` and an `Int` called `level`. It traces `"Simulation: $group
Reality: $level"`, then calls itself with `level - 1` as long as `level` is
greater than zero. The code in `main()` tests your solution.
