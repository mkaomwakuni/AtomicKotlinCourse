## Folding Lists (#4)

The starter code provides a `Condition` class and a function
`Condition.combine()` that combines two conditions. There's also a skeleton for
the `List<Condition>` extension function `combineAll()` that combines all the
conditions in the `List`. Complete the implementation using `reduce()`, assuming
the `List` is non-empty.
