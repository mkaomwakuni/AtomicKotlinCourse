## Complex Constructors (#2)

Create a class called `SumChars` that takes `text: String` as a constructor
parameter. Add an un-initialized property `val sum: Int`. Inside `init`, define
a local function `calc()` that sums up the integer values of each of the
characters in `text`. Call `calc()` and assign the result to `sum`.
