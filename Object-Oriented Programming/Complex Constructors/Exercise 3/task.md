## Complex Constructors (#3)

Show that multiple init sections are executed in declaration order. The starter
code contains `MultipleInit` class with a
`val initOrder = mutableListOf<String>()` property. Add the `String`s `"one"`,
`"two"` and `"three"` to the `initOrder` property in three different `init`
blocks.
