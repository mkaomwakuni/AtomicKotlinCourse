## Base Class Initialization (#1)

Create a class `A` with a constructor argument `val s: String`. Inherit `B` from
`A` and give `B` the identical constructor argument: `val s: String`. Inherit
`C` from `B`, also with the identical constructor argument. This will not
immediately work as described, but IntelliJ IDEA will coach you through what's
necessary to make it work.
