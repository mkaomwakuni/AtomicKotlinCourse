## Unit Testing (#1)

Starting with `SealedClasses/SealedClasses.kt`, test the function `travel()`
using the code in `main()` as inspiration. Create two test functions named
"train travel" and "bus travel" and use `assertEquals()` from `kotlin.test` to
compare the expected output to the actual output.
