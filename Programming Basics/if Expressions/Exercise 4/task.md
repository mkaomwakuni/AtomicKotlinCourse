## Mastering the IDE: Navigating to a Function

To navigate to a function definition, put the caret on the usage and press
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoDeclaration;</span>. Alternatively, you
can click on the symbol while holding the Ctrl key (or the Command key on Mac).

Put the caret on the `oneOrTheOther()` function call in `main()` and navigate
to the function definition.
