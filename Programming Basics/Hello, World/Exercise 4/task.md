## Mastering the IDE: Run

IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful tool that allows you to carry out common actions
in an efficient way. Running the `main()` function is an example of such an
action, and IntelliJ IDEA allows you to do that by pressing a shortcut. A
shortcut is a special key combination that causes a specific command to be
executed. Throughout this course, you'll learn common shortcuts.

IntelliJ IDEA is a *keyboard-centric IDE*, which means you can perform all
actions using only the keyboard. We recommend learning to do everything
with keyboard shortcuts.

Click on the icon next to the `main()` function to see what shortcut is
used by your operating system to run `main()`. The key combination appears
right after `run 'TaskKt'`. Run the `main()` function first by choosing
`run 'TaskKt'`, then by pressing the shortcut.
