## Data Types (#3)

Guess the results of the following expressions and then check your guesses
using Kotlin:

```kotlin
val c1 = 'a' + 1
val c2 = 'a' + 25
val c3 = 'E' - 2
```

You can open the hint within IntelliJ IDEA to understand the results.

Characters are stored as numbers corresponding to their
[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) values, so adding an integer to
a character produces a new character corresponding to the new code value.
