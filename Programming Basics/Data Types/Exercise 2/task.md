## Data Types (#2)

Attempt to combine various `val`s of different types using the `+` operator.
Only combine two at a time, and assign each combination to a `val` result. See
which types combine. On the console, display the name of the type that can be
combined with any other type if it goes first.

Replace the lines containing `TODO()` in the solution code with working code.
If you don't remove these lines, you'll see an error saying "Operation is not
implemented."
