## Mastering the IDE: Checking the inferred variable type

In the accompanying example, all the type declarations from `Types.kt` are
removed. Verify that Kotlin successfully infers the types.

If you put the caret on an identifier and press
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:QuickJavaDoc;</span>, you'll check the type
Kotlin infers for this identifier.

Press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorEscape;</span> to close the pop-up.

Check the types of all declared variables in the example.
