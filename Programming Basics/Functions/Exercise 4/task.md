## Mastering the IDE: More Intentions

You can automatically convert a function with a block body to a function with
an expression body, and vice versa. Put the caret somewhere on the `return`
keyword, press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ShowIntentionActions;</span>
to call the intention actions menu, and choose
<span class="control">`Convert to expression body`</span>.
After the conversion the type remains highlighted, which is
convenient because you can either remove the type declaration by pressing
`Delete` or leave it by moving the caret to the right.

To apply the reverse intention, press
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ShowIntentionActions;</span>
on the equal sign on the function with expression body and choose the
reverse conversion.

Apply <span class="control">`Convert to expression body`</span>, and then
<span class="control">`Convert to block body`</span> intention actions.
