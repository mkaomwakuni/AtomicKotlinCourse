## Mastering the IDE: Find Action

After a while, you'll memorize the shortcuts that you use most often, but
remembering all of them is almost impossible.

IntelliJ IDEA provides a universal way to call an action by its name. Simply
press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoAction;</span>. Alternatively, you
may choose <span class="control">`Help | Find Action`</span> on the main menu.

<span class="control">`Find action`</span>
allows you to enter the name you're looking for. You may type
only a part of the name, and IntelliJ shows all the names that fit.

Try typing the names of the actions that you've learned so far:

- <span class="control">`Specify type explicitly`</span>

- <span class="control">`Rename`</span>

- <span class="control">`Convert to expression/block body`</span>

- <span class="control">`Navigate to declaration`</span>

You can display the intention actions by calling the action
<span class="control">`Show intention actions`</span>, but it's such a common
operation that it's better to memorize a shortcut for it.

Rename `val x` and specify its type explicitly by calling the
corresponding actions using <span class="control">`Find action`</span>.
