## Mastering the IDE: Moving the Caret

You can move the caret a word at a time. The same works for selecting text:

| Operation                            | Shortcut                                                                 | Description                                       |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Move to Next Word                    | <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorNextWord;</span>                  | Move the caret to the next word.                  |
| Move to Previous Word                | <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorPreviousWord;</span>              | Move the caret to the previous word.              |
| Move to Next Word with Selection     | <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorNextWordWithSelection;</span>     | Move the caret to the next word, selecting it.    |
| Move to Previous Word with Selection | <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorPreviousWordWithSelection;</span> | Move the caret to the previous word, selecting it.|

Select `getFooResult()` by moving the caret over words and extract it into a
`val foo` by hand. Next we'll discuss how to extract a variable automatically.
