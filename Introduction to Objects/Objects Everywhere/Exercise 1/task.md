## Objects Everywhere (#1)

Palindromes are words or phrases that read the same forward and backward. For
example:

- "mom" is a palindrome

- "dad" is a palindrome

- "rotator" is a palindrome

- "streets" is *not* a palindrome

Write a function that checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome.

<div class="hint">

`String`'s `reversed()` member function may prove useful here. Use `==`
to check whether two `String`s are equivalent.

</div>
