## Exceptions (#3)

Implement a function named `repeatChar()` that takes parameters `ch` (the
character to be repeated) and `n` (the number of times to repeat it) and
returns a `String` consisting of `ch` repeated `n` times. The function throws
an `IllegalArgumentException` if `n` is negative. The exception message should
be `"Count 'n' must be non-negative, but was x."` where `x` is replaced with
the value of `n`.
