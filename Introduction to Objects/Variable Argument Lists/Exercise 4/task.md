## Variable Argument Lists (#4)

`flatten()` is the reverse operation for `chunked()` (from the previous
exercise). This function is called on a `List` of `List`s and returns a single
`List` of all elements from the nested `List`s. Implement `flatten()` without
using the `flatten()` function from the standard library.
