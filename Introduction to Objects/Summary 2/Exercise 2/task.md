## Summary 2 (#2)

Create a class named `Boring2` that is just like `Boring` except it has
constructor parameters, which are all `val`s. The parameter `a` holds the value
that `a()` produces, the parameter `b` holds the value that `b()` produces, and
`c` holds the value produced by `c()`. Test `Boring2` using `atomictest`.
