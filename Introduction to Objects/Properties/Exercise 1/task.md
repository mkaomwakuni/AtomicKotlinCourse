## Properties (#1)

Create a class `X` that contains three `Int` properties: `a` and `b` are `val`s
and `c` is a `var`. Initialize `a` to 3, `b` to 42, and `c` to zero. Create an
`add()` member function that sums `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `c`,
then returns `c`. Write a `main()` to test `X`.
