## Mastering the IDE: Comment / Uncomment

You can comment and uncomment a line of code by using the shortcut:
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CommentByLineComment;</span>. Calling this
action on an uncommented line will comment it, and calling it on a commented
line will uncomment it.

Using this shortcut is much faster than commenting or uncommenting lines by
hand.

Using the shortcut, uncomment the first `println()` and comment the second
one.
