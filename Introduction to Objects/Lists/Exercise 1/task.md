## Lists (#1)

The Kotlin standard library contains many functions that work with `List`s.
It's educational to implement some of them by hand.

Write a function `findMax()` that finds the maximum value in a `List` of
*natural numbers* (positive whole numbers). If the `List` is empty, return
zero. `findMax()` takes `IntList` as a parameter---this is an example class in
the starter code that only allows you to iterate over a `List`'s contents, get
its size and access elements by index.
