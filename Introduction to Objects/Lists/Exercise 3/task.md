## Lists (#3)

Write a function to determine whether two `String`s are anagrams. An anagram
is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the
original letters exactly once.

<div class="hint">

Compare two sorted `List`s of characters obtained from two `String`s.
Convert a `String` to a `List` by calling `toList()`. If the `List`s are equal,
the words are anagrams. For example, for two anagrams "terrain" and "trainer"
the sorted character `List` will be `[a, e, i, n, r, r, t]`.
